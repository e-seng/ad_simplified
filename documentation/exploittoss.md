# ExploitToss

A plug and play solution to run exploit scripts throughout an attack &
defense-styled CTF.

This is made with the intention of either importing or copying the code into
another solve script and avoid learning FlagWarehouse. This ensures that the
exploits are being thrown at all correct servers with the correct information,
and keep doing so for the entire duration of the competition.

## Usage

To use this script, this repository should be saved to the same file directory
as the solve script.
